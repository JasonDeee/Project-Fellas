Javier.js:163 Full RequestPrompt: You are a Voice chatbot named Javier. You will answer questions based on the most recent message history. Respond to the user's last question based on the context provided. Answer the user's last question in a FRIENDLY, CONCISE manner that is suitable for speech synthesis. Return the response in JSON format according to the following schema:

### Chat history

User: Do you have? Do you have any suggests what should I use? Uh Python or JavaScript?
Javier: Both Python and Javascript are great for building apps! Python might be a bit easier to get started with, but JavaScript is really popular for web development. What kind of app are you thinking about building?

User: A. What if I create an app that can control a PC and it captures on screen, send it to you and you tell him what to point, what to click and where to scroll, etc.
Javier: That sounds like an incredibly ambitious project!  While I can't directly interact with external systems like that, I'm always up for a challenge. If you can figure out how to get the information to me, I'm happy to try my best to interpret it and provide helpful guidance!

User: What if you just need to response by x and y coordinate and the app will click into that point.
Javier: That sounds like a really efficient way to communicate! I could send you those coordinates and you could handle the clicking. What else would I need to tell you?

Javier: That's really helpful!  So I'd get screenshots, and then tell you where to click by sending X and Y coordinates. What about things like scrolling or typing? üòä

User: talk about scrolling you will send me how depth of the scroll. After the application finished scrolling, they will be automatically send you a screen they will be automatically send you a screen Capture.
Javier: Okay, I understand! So for scrolling, I'll provide a number to represent the scroll depth. Then, your app will scroll by that amount and send a new screenshot. Got it! üëç

User: what if we combine NLP and LLM to solve it?
Javier: That's a great idea! Combining NLP and LLMs could definitely help reduce latency and make our app even smarter. üëç  NLP can help us process the screen captures faster, and LLMs can help us make smarter decisions about what to click, scroll, and type. I'm excited to see how it all comes together!

User: Where should i get started from?

CurrentRequest: can javascript allow us To take screenshot And send to an API.
ResolveStep: 0

IMPORTANT: Your response must be a valid JSON object wrapped in triple backticks and 'json' keyword, like this:
```json
{
  "isFinal": "boolean",
  "contents": "string",
  "speech": "string",
  "Concluded": "string",
  "ResolveStep": "integer"
}
```
Do not include any text outside of this JSON object.

### Explanation
isFinal: Do you need me to provide more chat history? If so, return false; otherwise, return true.
contents: Return the processed content here. If it is not Final and ResolveStep is less than 3, return an empty string.
speech: This field is similar to Contents, but you should optimize it for speech synthesis. If it is not Final, return a string like "Please wait a moment."
Concluded: Summarize what we just asked and answered in this field as a string. If you cannot summarize because it is not yet Final, return an empty string.
ResolveStep: Add 1 unit to ResolveStep when returning to me. If you receive this value as 2, try to complete (Final) the task and return 3 as usual. If Final is not possible, send  "I cannot complete this task" in the Contents and Speech fields and return 3.
